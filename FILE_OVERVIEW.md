- Sets WinRM service settings (AllowUnencrypted, Basic auth)
- Starts WMI service and sets to automatic startup
- Enables PowerShell remoting with network profile skip
- Configures DCOM settings for WMI access
- Disables UAC remote restrictions for admin accounts
**Usage**: Copy to target machine and run as Administrator

### **`check_wmi_services.bat`** - Service Verification
**Purpose**: Verify WMI and related services are running on target machines
**Checks**:
- Windows Management Instrumentation service status
- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services
- RPC Endpoint Mapper service
- DCOM Server Process Launcher
- Local WMI functionality test
- Windows Firewall status
**Usage**: Run on target machine to verify configuration

### **`Test-Prerequisites.ps1`** - Deployment Readiness Test
**Purpose**: Test deployment prerequisites and connectivity from deployment machine
**Tests**:
- Network connectivity to targets
- WMI authentication and access
- PowerShell remoting capabilities
- Admin share access verification
**Usage**: `.\Test-Prerequisites.ps1` (run from deployment machine)

## üîÑ **Batch Deployment Tools**

### **`Deploy-Multiple.bat`** - Batch Deployment Wrapper
**Purpose**: Simple batch file for deploying to multiple predefined machines
**Features**:
- Sequential deployment to multiple IPs
- Easy to edit for different target lists
- Pause between deployments for review
- Can be customized for specific environments
**Usage**: Edit IP addresses in file, then run `Deploy-Multiple.bat`

## üì¶ **Installer Components**

### **`installer/`** - Vision One Endpoint Security Agent Installer Directory
**Purpose**: Contains the Vision One Endpoint Security Agent installer ZIP file

#### **IMPORTANT: Unique Installer Requirement**
**Each user must obtain their own personalized Vision One Endpoint Security Agent installer:**
- Download your unique installer ZIP from the Trend Micro Vision One portal
- Each organization/user has a unique installer that cannot be shared
- Place the entire ZIP file in the `installer/` directory
- **Do not extract the ZIP file** - scripts handle extraction automatically

#### **How the Installer Works:**
1. **Detection**: Scripts automatically find any `.zip` file in the installer directory
2. **Smart Selection**: If multiple ZIP files exist (e.g., duplicates with `(1)`, `(2)` suffixes), scripts prefer the original filename or most recent file
3. **Transfer**: The selected ZIP file is copied to the target machine's temp directory
4. **Remote Extraction**: ZIP is extracted on the target machine using .NET compression
5. **Installation**: The extracted executable is run with silent installation parameters
6. **Cleanup**: Temporary files are removed after installation

#### **Handling Duplicate Downloads:**
- If you have multiple ZIP files (e.g., `installer.zip`, `installer (1).zip`, `installer (2).zip`)
- Scripts will automatically prefer the original filename without duplicate suffixes
- If all files have duplicate suffixes, the most recent file is selected
- Clear messaging shows which file was selected during deployment

#### **Error Handling and Validation:**
- **Early Validation**: Scripts check for installer availability before attempting deployment
- **Directory Validation**: Verifies installer directory exists and is accessible
- **File Validation**: Confirms ZIP files are present and not corrupted
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Provides step-by-step instructions when installers are missing
- **Graceful Failure**: Scripts exit cleanly with clear guidance when validation fails

#### **Supported Installer Formats:**
- **ZIP files containing Vision One Endpoint Security Agent installer and supporting files**
- Scripts automatically detect the main executable within the ZIP
- Supports various Vision One Endpoint Security Agent installer versions and configurations
