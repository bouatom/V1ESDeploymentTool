# Security Considerations for VisionOne SEP Deployment Tool

## Deployment Method Risk Assessment

### 1. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) - **RECOMMENDED**
**Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Native Windows remote management
- Well-established security model
- Auditable through Windows Event Logs
- No persistent artifacts left behind

⚠️ **Risks:**
- Requires WMI service enabled
- Credentials transmitted (encrypted by WMI)
- Administrative privileges required

### 2. Native WinRM (Windows Remote Management) - **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**
**Risk Level: LOW**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Native Windows remote management protocol
- Built-in authentication and encryption (Kerberos/NTLM)
- HTTPS support for enhanced security
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Session-based execution with proper cleanup
- Better timeout and connection management
- Industry standard for Windows remote management

⚠️ **Risks:**
- Requires WinRM service enabled on targets
- Network firewall configuration needed (ports 5985/5986)
- Administrative privileges required

### 3. PowerShell Remoting - **RECOMMENDED**
**Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Modern Windows remote management
- Strong authentication and encryption
- Session-based execution
- Comprehensive logging capabilities

⚠️ **Risks:**
- Requires PowerShell remoting enabled
- May trigger security software alerts
- Administrative privileges required

### 4. Scheduled Tasks - **HIGH RISK - USE WITH CAUTION**
**Risk Level: HIGH**

❌ **Major Security Risks:**
- **Credential Exposure**: Passwords visible in command line
- **Persistence Risk**: Failed cleanup leaves tasks on systems
- **Privilege Escalation**: Tasks run with high privileges
- **Detection Evasion**: May be used by attackers for persistence
- **Audit Trail**: Limited logging compared to other methods

⚠️ **Operational Risks:**
- Task naming conflicts
- Cleanup failures leave orphaned tasks
- Timing-dependent execution
- Limited error reporting

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Credential Management
```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "username": "DOMAIN\\ServiceAccount",  // Use dedicated service account
    "password": "ComplexPassword123!",     // Strong password
    "domain": "YOURDOMAIN"
  }
}
```

**Recommendations:**
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required privileges
- Rotate passwords regularly
- Consider using Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)
- Store config files with restricted permissions (600/640)

### 2. Network Security
- Deploy from secure management networks
- Use VPN or secure channels for remote deployment
- Implement network segmentation
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### 3. Logging and Monitoring
```json
{
  "logging": {
    "log_level": "INFO",           // Capture sufficient detail
    "log_file": "deployment.log"   // Secure log storage
  }
}
```

**Monitor for:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual deployment patterns
- Scheduled task creation/deletion
- Network scanning activities

### 4. Scheduled Task Security (If Enabled)
```json
{
  "security": {
    "allow_scheduled_tasks": false,  // Disable by default
    "require_cleanup_verification": true
  }
}
```

**If you must use scheduled tasks:**
- Enable only when other methods fail
- Monitor task creation/deletion
- Implement cleanup verification
- Use unique task names to avoid conflicts
- Run with minimal required privileges

## Recommended Deployment Order

1. **Native WinRM** - Try first (most secure, industry standard)
2. **WMI** - Fallback (reliable, good security)
3. **PowerShell Remoting** - Alternative (modern, secure)
4. **Scheduled Tasks** - Last resort only (high risk)

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Service account created with minimal privileges
- [ ] Strong password policy enforced
- [ ] Config file permissions restricted
- [ ] Network access controls in place
- [ ] Logging infrastructure ready
- [ ] WinRM service enabled on target systems
- [ ] WinRM HTTPS configured (recommended for production)
- [ ] Firewall rules configured (ports 5985/5986)

### During Deployment
- [ ] Monitor authentication events
- [ ] Watch for failed deployments
- [ ] Check for orphaned scheduled tasks
- [ ] Verify installer file integrity

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify agent installation
- [ ] Clean up temporary files
- [ ] Review deployment logs
- [ ] Check for security alerts
- [ ] Rotate service account password

## Incident Response

### If Scheduled Tasks Are Left Behind
```bash
# List all VisionOne SEP installation tasks
schtasks /query /s TARGET_HOST /fo csv | findstr "VisionOneSEPInstall"

# Remove orphaned tasks
schtasks /delete /s TARGET_HOST /tn "TASK_NAME" /f
```

### If Credentials Are Compromised
1. Immediately disable the service account
2. Review all deployment logs
3. Check for unauthorized access
4. Rotate all related passwords
5. Audit affected systems

## Alternative Secure Deployment Methods

Consider these alternatives for high-security environments:

1. **Group Policy Software Installation**
2. **SCCM/ConfigMgr Deployment**
3. **Ansible with WinRM**
4. **Puppet/Chef Configuration Management**
5. **Manual Installation with Remote Desktop**

## Compliance Considerations

- **SOX**: Ensure proper change management and audit trails
- **PCI DSS**: Secure credential handling and network segmentation
- **HIPAA**: Encrypt communications and maintain access logs
- **ISO 27001**: Risk assessment and security controls documentation

## Conclusion

While the deployment tool provides multiple methods for flexibility, prioritize WMI and PowerShell remoting for security. Only enable scheduled task deployment in controlled environments with proper monitoring and cleanup procedures.

## WinRM Setup for Enhanced Security

### Target System Configuration

**Enable WinRM (run as Administrator):**
```cmd
# Basic WinRM setup
winrm quickconfig -y

# Configure authentication
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="false";Kerberos="true";Negotiate="true";Certificate="false";CredSSP="false"}

# Set memory limits
winrm set winrm/config/winrs @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="1024"}

# Configure timeouts
winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms="300000"}
```

**HTTPS Configuration (Recommended for Production):**
```cmd
# Create self-signed certificate (or use CA-issued cert)
New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "hostname.domain.com" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My

# Configure HTTPS listener
winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTPS @{Hostname="hostname.domain.com";CertificateThumbprint="THUMBPRINT"}

# Configure firewall
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM HTTPS" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5986
```

**Security Hardening:**
```cmd
# Disable HTTP if using HTTPS
winrm delete winrm/config/Listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP

# Restrict allowed users
winrm configSDDL default

# Enable logging
winrm set winrm/config/service @{EnableCompatibilityHttpListener="false"}
```

### Deployment Tool Configuration

**Enable WinRM HTTPS in config:**
```json
{
  "security": {
    "use_winrm_https": true,
    "winrm_timeout": 300,
    "preferred_methods": ["WinRM", "WMI", "PowerShell"]
  }
}
```

**Remember**: Security is a balance between functionality and risk. Choose the most secure method that meets your operational requirements.
